          Yarnpie is a simple, cozy tool for yarn lovers to keep track of their
          yarn stash and projects â€” all in one place. Whether you're the type to
          hoard the softest skeins, start ten projects at once, or you're just
          starting out, Yarnpie helps you:
          <ul>
            <li>
              ðŸŒ¸ <b>Organize your yarn stash</b> with photos, fiber details, and
              yardage.
            </li>
            <li>ðŸ§µ <b>Track your projects</b> and how much yarn you've used. </li>
          </ul>
          Inspired by the magpie's instinct to gather beautiful things, Yarnpie
          brings a touch of charm to staying organized. No spreadsheets, no
          stress â€” just a more delightful way to manage your making.
